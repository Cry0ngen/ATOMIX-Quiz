<p><h3>This is a simple educational Quiz game aimed at High School students, still not 100% finished, deadlines are the bane of my existence.</h3></p>
<p>The whole thing was made as a project for one of my college classes, where we needed to identify topics students had difficulties in relation to chemistry, maths or physics, then come up with a way to help them understand the chosen topics.</p>
<p>This was kinda a nightmare to make as someone who's not used to messing around with unity but I think it turned out okayish.</p>
